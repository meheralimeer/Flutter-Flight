# Flutter Fellowship

This repository contains the work I've completed as part of the Flutter Fellowship. It showcases my progress and understanding of the Dart and Flutter concepts.

## Structure

The repository is organized into tasks, with each task representing a module or a set of related concepts.

- **task1:** Covers the basics of the Dart language, including data types, operators, control flow, functions, collections, and null safety.

As I progress through the fellowship, I will add more tasks and projects to this repository.
